# Computatioal Physics Tools

This repository is a collection of tools I wrote to learn implementation of some specific skills by applying it to some simple physical problem. A lot of this comes from refining the code I wrote for my 'Computation Physics' and 'Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics' courses. 

The latest version has the following use cases: 

1. Parallelizing Python Code (to solve for Kepler orbits)
2. Adaptive Step-Size Runge Kutta (to solve stellar hydrostatic equilibrium)
3. Iterative Crank Nicholson Integrator (to solve Schrodinger Equation for arbitrary potentials + generate GIFs of wavefunction)
