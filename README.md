# Computational Physics Tools

This repository is a collection of tools I wrote to learn implementation of some specific computational skills by applying them to some simple (and some not so simple) physical problem. A lot of this comes from refining the scripts I wrote for my 'Computational Physics' and 'Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics' courses. 

Current version has the following: 

1. Parallelizing Python Code (to solve for Kepler orbits)

Developed and current being optimized for the next update:

1. Iterative Crank Nicholson Integrator (to solve Schrodinger Equation for arbitrary potentials + generate GIFs of wavefunction)
2. Adaptive Step-Size Runge Kutta (to solve stellar hydrostatic equilibrium)

In the pipeline for near future:

1. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (to solve, hopefully, some NR system)
2. GPU Acceleration
