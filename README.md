# Computational Physics Tools

This repository is a collection of tools I wrote to learn implementation of some specific computational skills by applying them to some simple (and some not so simple) physical problem. A lot of this comes from refining the scripts I wrote for my 'Computational Physics' and 'Computational Astrophysics and Geophysics' courses. 

Current version has the following: 

1. [Py] Parallelizing Python Code (to solve for Kepler orbits)
2. [Py] Iterative Crank Nicholson Integrator (to solve Schrodinger Equation for arbitrary potentials + generate animations of probability distribution)

Developed and current being optimized for the next update:

1. [Jl] Adaptive Step-Size Runge Kutta (to solve for White-Dwarf )

In the pipeline for near future:

1. [Jl] Adaptive Mesh Refinement (to solve, hopefully, some NR system)
2. [Jl] GPU Acceleration (to solve N-body problems with CUDA)
